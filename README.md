# Clash-Of-Pawn-AI
Bot for playing advanced version of breakthrough board game.

# Game Description
Clash of Pawns is a variant of a popular strategy Board-Game Breakthrough.
Breakthrough was designed by William Daniel 'Dan' Troyka in 2000 and originally
played on a  7x7 board. After the size of the board was changed, it won the 2001 8x8
Game Design Competition, sponsored by About Board Games, Abstract Games
Magazine and the Strategy Gaming Society. The game is simple but addictive -- the
goal is to try to get one of your pieces to the other side of the board before your
opponent does the same. The game is for 2 players to play.

# Rules Of Game
* This variant is played on a 12 X 12 board between two players.
* The white player goes first; then play alternates, with each player moving one piece per turn.
* A piece may move one space straight or diagonally forward if the target square is empty.
* A piece may move into a square containing an opponent's piece if and only if that square is one step diagonally forward. The opponent's piece is removed and the player's piece replaces it.
* The first player to reach the opponent's home row — the one farthest from the player — is the winner. If all the pieces of a player are captured, that player loses.
* White moves vertically downwards and Black moves vertically upwards.
* A draw is impossible because pieces can only move ahead (or be captured), and the piece closest to the opponent's home row always has at least one forward diagonal move available.
